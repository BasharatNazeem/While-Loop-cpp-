# While-Loop-cpp-
This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates the use of the while loop. The while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It's especially useful when you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance but want the loop to continue until a condition is met.
